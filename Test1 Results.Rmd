## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE, Box_Plots, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=7}
drug.df$prediction = as.factor(drug.df$prediction)
drug.df$probability = as.factor(drug.df$probability)
## Including Plots


  ggplot(aes(x = probability, y = prediction), data = drug.df, group = 1) +
 geom_line()+
  geom_point()

```
